			<h2> About </h2>
			<p> I am a master's student in Computer Science at the Unviersity of Toronto. I am interesed in the <b>cultural politics of emotion, labour, and identity
				in computing education and tech work</b>.
				My work lies at the intersection of and seeks to contribute to <b>Science and Technology Studies</b>,
				<b>Human Computer Interaction</b>, <b>Feminist Technoscience</b>, and <b>Computer Science Education</b>. </p>

			<br>
			<h2> Questions to Consider </h2>
			<p> The following are some questions students might consider as they work:
				<ul>
  					<li>Who is this for?</li>
  					<li>Is this something the users/target audience actually want? Are users involved in 
						the design process? Have you gotten user feedback?</li>
					<li>Are you coding?
						<ul>
							<li> Are you writing everything yourself?</li>
							<li> Are you clearly documenting your code?</li>
							<li> How much space is it using? How fast does it run? Can you minimize these?</li>
							<li> Are you using someone elseâ€™s code? Do you understand how it works? Have you cited them?</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What processes of extraction are taking place? (labour? environment? data?)
						<ul>
							<li>Where is your work taking place?</li>
							<li>Is it a virtual space? Where are the physical spaces that allow this space to exist?</li>
							<li>Do you know where the materials come from? Do you know where the materials for those materials come from?</li>
							<li>Was there waste created?</li>
							<li>Who is creating these materials (where is the labour coming from)?</li>
							<li>Is data being collected? How is it being used? Is it necessary to collect this data? 
								What biases might there be in collecting this data? 
								What labour is needed for people to provide this data?</li>
							
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>What effect might this tech have on other communities?</li>
					<li>What unintended purposes could this tech be used for?</li>
					<li>Should it be made?</li>
					<li>How can I use tech for positive change? Am I addressing the root of the problem, or fixing symptoms?</li>
					<li>What other questions should I be asking?</li>
					
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This list of questions is by no means inclusive, and should be used as a starting place for raising your own questions.
				Ethics should never be a checklist [see the following for a satyrical paper that makes clear why: 
				<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.06166.pdf"> A Mulching Proposal by Os Keyes, Jevan Hutson, and Meridith Durbin </a>].
